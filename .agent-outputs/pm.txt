APP NAME: MessageClearance ✈️
TAGLINE: "Your message has been cleared for takeoff."

TARGET USER: Remote workers sending 50+ messages/day who worry about tone in async communication.

CORE FEATURES (prioritized):
P0 - MVP:
  1. Tone Scanner - detects passive-aggressive/rude/vague with explanations
  2. Three Rewrite Buttons - Short & direct | Warm & human | Confident & assertive
  3. Boarding Pass Verdict - ✅ Good to send | ⚠️ Needs edit | 🚨 High risk

P1 - Should Have:
  4. Missing Info Detector - flags what readers will ask next
  5. Subject/Opener Suggestion - better first lines for emails/DMs

P2 - Nice to Have:
  6. Safety Check Toggle - warns about sensitive data (regex, no AI)
  7. Model Selector - fast/cheap vs best quality
